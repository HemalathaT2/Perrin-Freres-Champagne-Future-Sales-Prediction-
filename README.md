# Perrin Freres Champagne Sales Prediction

This repository contains the code and documentation for Perrin Freres Champagne's sales prediction project using ARIMA and seasonal ARIMA models. The goal of this project is to forecast future sales for Perrin Freres Champagne based on historical sales data.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to develop accurate and reliable sales predictions for Perrin Freres Champagne. By utilizing the ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) and seasonal ARIMA models, we aim to capture the underlying patterns and trends in the sales data and make informed forecasts.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of historical sales data for Perrin Freres Champagne. It includes information such as the date and the corresponding sales figures. This data will be used to train and validate the ARIMA and seasonal ARIMA models.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `data/`: This directory contains the dataset used for training and evaluation.
- `notebooks/`: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks used for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `models/`: This directory will contain the trained ARIMA and seasonal ARIMA models once they are saved.
- `src/`: This directory contains the source code for the project, including functions for data preprocessing, model training, and prediction.
- `results/`: This directory will store the prediction results generated by the models.
- `README.md`: This file provides an overview of the project and instructions for running the code.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are required to run the code in this repository:

- Python 3.7+
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Statsmodels
- Matplotlib

To install the necessary dependencies, you can use the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run the sales prediction models, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/perrin-freres-champagne-sales-prediction.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd perrin-freres-champagne-sales-prediction
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to preprocess the data, train the models, and evaluate the performance.

5. Once the models are trained, you can use the functions provided in the `src/` directory to make predictions on new data.

## Results

The results of the sales predictions will be stored in the `results/` directory. These files will include the predicted sales figures and any relevant evaluation metrics.

## Conclusion

This project aims to provide accurate sales predictions for Perrin Freres Champagne using ARIMA and seasonal ARIMA models. By forecasting future sales, Perrin Freres Champagne can make more informed decisions regarding production, inventory management, and marketing strategies.
